The past few days have seen my Twitter feed filled with posts about a new COVID-19 variant - Omicron.  One thing that has struck me is that among the virologists and infection disease experts I follow, almost all of them have noted that while there are aspects of the mutations that are noteworthy and *potentially* concerning (specifically, the degree to which the strain has mutated) there's not much information yet and so there's a lot of uncertainty regarding how those mutations impact how bad or not bad Omicron will be.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">There have been a number of overview threads on the emerging variant designated as <a href="https://twitter.com/PangoNetwork?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@PangoNetwork</a> lineage B.1.1.529, <a href="https://twitter.com/nextstrain?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@nextstrain</a> clade 21K and <a href="https://twitter.com/WHO?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@WHO</a> Variant of Concern Omicron.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We&#39;ll know much more about Omicron soon......<br>Excellent summary of where we stand, including the lab tests underway, by <a href="https://twitter.com/kakape?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@kakape</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/ScienceMagazine?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@ScienceMagazine</a> <a href="https://t.co/7ypVVGvYPG">https://t.co/7ypVVGvYPG</a> <a href="https://t.co/N4rTIty9z8">pic.twitter.com/N4rTIty9z8</a></p>&mdash; Eric Topol (@EricTopol) <a href="https://twitter.com/EricTopol/status/1464720179858849794?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 27, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

In summary, while scientists see things that are potentially concerning, they also largely seem to be saying "we won't know until we have more data".

News media, on the other hand, seem to have picked up on the fact that in all this uncertainty, there are some alarming "could be" possibilities that play well to get clicks.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Scientists in South Africa are scrambling to combat the new COVID-19 variant omicron&#39;s lightning spread across the country. The country’s case numbers are still relatively low, but omicron’s speed in infecting young people has alarmed health professionals. <a href="https://t.co/VivL20qIAK">https://t.co/VivL20qIAK</a></p>&mdash; The Associated Press (@AP) <a href="https://twitter.com/AP/status/1464598770822361099?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 27, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The discovery of a new and potentially more transmissible coronavirus variant by South African health authorities has sparked a forceful reaction across the world, with a number of countries banning travelers from several southern African countries. <a href="https://t.co/qh0DEnXCxT">https://t.co/qh0DEnXCxT</a></p>&mdash; CNN (@CNN) <a href="https://twitter.com/CNN/status/1464454945856495621?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 27, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

At least the NYT had the self-control to headline that there's a lot we don't know as it reported the typical overreaction of financial markets and governments.
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The highly mutated variant, named Omicron, battered financial markets and prompted the U.S. and other countries to impose travel restrictions even as the W.H.O. cautioned that very little was known about the variant. <a href="https://t.co/l1605fpZ5i">https://t.co/l1605fpZ5i</a></p>&mdash; The New York Times (@nytimes) <a href="https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/1464591606112309255?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 27, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Unsurprisingly, though, some of their tweets on the variant played more alarmist angles...
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">South African scientists will meet with WHO experts on Friday to discuss a concerning new coronavirus variant.<br><br>B.1.1.529 has a &quot;very unusual constellation of mutations,&quot; one scientist said, and it&#39;s unclear how effective vaccines will be against it. <a href="https://t.co/mwSskGoxWB">https://t.co/mwSskGoxWB</a></p>&mdash; The New York Times (@nytimes) <a href="https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/1464187202561359886?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 26, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

This NBC tweet seemed a little more balanced in how it presented the story...
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">WHO names new Covid strain first identified in southern Africa &quot;omicron&quot; and calls it a &quot;variant of concern.&quot; <a href="https://t.co/AS4HqeTGYk">https://t.co/AS4HqeTGYk</a></p>&mdash; NBC News (@NBCNews) <a href="https://twitter.com/NBCNews/status/1464630614930464770?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 27, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

But then this one spins a bit more towards alarmism
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Experts are concerned about a new coronavirus variant detected in South Africa because of its high number of mutations and rapid spread among young people. <a href="https://t.co/K4HT8q7tot">https://t.co/K4HT8q7tot</a></p>&mdash; NBC News (@NBCNews) <a href="https://twitter.com/NBCNews/status/1464237023166971914?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 26, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

While we're talking bad media takes, why not use alarmism to justify protectionism and hatred of migrants?!?
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">New migrant caravan heading to US, increasing concerns about the spread of omicron COVID variant<a href="https://t.co/J82PQWQcRy">https://t.co/J82PQWQcRy</a></p>&mdash; Fox News (@FoxNews) <a href="https://twitter.com/FoxNews/status/1464723207789821955?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 27, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

And more bad takes, LOL at splicing editorial interjections into a Fauci quote to make it sound even *more* alarming.  Not that this qualifies as media, but if you find yourself always agreeing with tweets you read from an account like the one below (or above for that matter), you might suffer from chronic blind partisanship.
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">BREAKING: Dr. Fauci says we must &quot;be careful&quot; because he &quot;would not be surprised&quot; if the dangerous Omicron strain of coronavirus is already in the U.S. and that it will eventually go &quot;all over&quot; the world.

It hasn't been all bad takes, though.  I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that there's at least one reporter who's drawing attention to some material suggesting there may be reason for hope that Omicron isn't so bad (although again, it's very early and these reports are anecdotal rather than a statistically significant collection of outcomes).
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">South African doctor who raised alarm about Omicron: “Their symptoms were so different and so mild from those I had treated before&quot;<a href="https://t.co/wGPaJeEn7y">https://t.co/wGPaJeEn7y</a><br><br>It&#39;s way, way, way too soon to take this news to the bank, but I&#39;m depositing a few tokens of hope anyway</p>&mdash; Derek Thompson (@DKThomp) <a href="https://twitter.com/DKThomp/status/1464703536961409027?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 27, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

You know what?  Thank you *The Atlantic*.  This is clear and gets at the current state of things without taking an alarmist tone.
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">“What’s known so far absolutely warrants attention—not panic. Viruses mutate; they always do.

So long and short of it?  We don't know.  So don't freak out.
