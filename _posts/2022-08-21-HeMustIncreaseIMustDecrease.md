> He must increase, but I must decrease.

On Sunday morning at [Grace Harbor Church](graceharbor.net), Kevin preached a sermon from [John 3:22-36](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+3%3A22-36&version=CSB), in which John the Baptist provides a beautiful model of humbly living for Christ's glory. It was a very helpful reminder in a world that is driven so much by comparison, competition, and a desire for self-affirmation.
