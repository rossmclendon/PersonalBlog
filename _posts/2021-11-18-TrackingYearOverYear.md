As we head out of fall and into winter, I find it helpful to compare how things are going this year versus last year.  Are cases rising in the same way?  Are the hospitals filling up like last year, or are vaccinations helping to reduce the number of people becoming severely ill even if they're not entirely preventing infections?  Are rising infection numbers or hospitalizations leading to spikes in COVID deaths?  I think these are important things to get a grasp of as we chart a course for "living with COVID-19", so to help do that, I've grabbed [data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1c2QrNMz8pIbYEKzMJL7Uh2dtThOJa2j1sSMwiDo5Gz4/edit#gid=264100583) from the [Rhode Island Department of Health](https://ri-department-of-health-covid-19-data-rihealth.hub.arcgis.com/) and put it into self-updating (as long as RIDOH keeps their Google Sheet available and formatted consistently) year-over-year plots below.  And for further transparency, [here's the viewable Google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10RmBL1EsHfjn50ieVH63NGDGWogffHvrVeUMZXbT7-c/edit?usp=sharing) that's generating these charts.  You can see in field A2 where I'm grabbing data from the RIDOH spreadsheet.
