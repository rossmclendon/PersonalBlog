To make up for not sending out a Christmas card the past two years, I'll be adding an update about our family here.  Right now this is full of placeholders.  If I haven't finished it by the time you land on this page, I'm sorry - extra time has been hard to come by lately.

# Family Members
Updates on all the McLendon clan...

## Michael
We'll start with the biggest change in our family - Michael, who arrived in March.

## Lucy
WE HAVE A TEENAGER!  Lucy turned 13 this October, and started 8th grade this autumn - her 2nd year at West Bay Christian Academy.  She continues to be a voracious reader, devouring books as quickly as she can pick them up.  Back in the spring she ran on the track team at West Bay and just recently finished the Cross Country season at West Bay.  She's just getting started with basketball practice for what will be her 2nd season.  She's also active in the youth group at Grace Harbor and has recently gotten started with a local Scouts troop.

## Ethan
Ethan turned 11 in August.  After finishing 5th grade at Hoxsie in Warwick, he has started as a 6th grader at West Bay Christian Academy.  This year he played flag football in the winter, Little League baseball in the spring and fall, and ran cross country in the fall.  He just started basketball practice with the boys team from West Bay - a new team sport for him.

## Carolyn
Carolyn is a 3rd grader at Providence Classical Academy, a new hybrid classical school that was inagurated this year. She is active in dance and gymnastics.

## Katie
Katie is a 1st grader at Providence Classical Academy, a new hybrid classical school that was inagurated this year. Like her sister Carolyn, she's active in dance and gymnastics.

## Meredith
Meredith is a superwoman mother of 5 and wife of 1.  I need to bug her to write a bit of an update for herself that I'll put here.

## Ross
I'll put something here later on.

# Significant Events
The year had a number of significant events.

## Holiday Trip to Texas
We kicked off 2024 in Texas visiting family.

## Ski Getaway
We had a lot of fun at Bretton Woods over the February Break

## Eclipse Adventure
Originally planned to be a trip to Dallas, weather ended up making us shift plans last minute to rent an RV and drive it with a bunch of friends from Church to Vermont where we took in totality.

## Meredith and Michael Getaway to Texas
Meredith took Michael to Texas this summer to introduce him to grandparents and other family.

## Family Summer Trip to Texas
We made a family trip to Texas before the school year started to get a little more time in with family.

## Aurora Chasing
We're at a solar maximum which yielded several exceptionally strong geomagnetic storms that resulted in Aurora that were visible in New England.  All the kiddos (other than Michael) had the opportunity to see them first-hand!
