Hi, I'm Ross, and this is my website.
I wear a few different hats.
I'm a Christian, husband, and father of four.
My day job is working as a software developer at Dassault Systemes (DS).  I work in the SIMULIA brand developing codes to perform structural mechanics simulations where my particular area of expertise is in multiscale material simulation.  I started work at DS after finishing my graduate studies in Aerospace Engineering at Texas A&M Univeristy.
I also have a number of hobbies including photography (which has become a little bit of a [side-hustle](https://rossmclendonphotography.com)) and singing (I'm a member of the [Providence Singers](https://providencesingers.org)).

I've created this website to collect a variety of musings, particularly as I see more and more issues inherent in the social media platforms where I've historically posted material (although I plan to continue being present on social media, at least for now).  I don't know what all my posts will end up being, but I'm guessing the following subjects are likely to come up:
- My faith
- Engineering simulation
- Aerospace
- My family
- Political musings
- Data analysis

Thanks for visiting.  If you want to reach out, ping me on one of my social media accounts.
