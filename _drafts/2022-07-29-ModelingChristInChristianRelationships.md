I've recently been thinking about relationships in the church and how the Bible calls us to treat one another.  It's an extremely important issue - one that's central to the way the church displays the Gospel of Jesus Christ.  In John 13:34-35, while Jesus is having His last meal with his disciples before his arrest and crucifixion, He tells them 
>I give you a new command: Love one another. Just as I have loved you, you are also to love one another. By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another.
>
>John 13:34-35 (CSB)

In fact, in John's account of the last supper, Christ returns to this command to "love one another" two other times after this ([15:12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John.15.12&version=CSB) and [15:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John.15.17&version=CSB)).  This was the last time Christ would sit down with His followers before he was crucified, and it's perhaps the point he drives home hardest in that precious little time they had left to sit together.  Clearly, Christ cares a lot about the relationships between His followers, because the way we treat one another is meant to testify about the way that God has treated us.

Because of this, when we allow division and anger to fester between one another in the church, we're scandalizing the Gospel by bearing false witness about Jesus.  Jesus leaves us no room for harboring a grudge or anger towards a brother or sister in Christ.

Christ's command to love one another is good and clear, but Christians are sinners in churches full of other sinners.  Conflict is going to arise; it's just a matter of when.  How do you handle it when it does?

A few pieces of guidance from scripture are helpful for us, and give us two big major points of application
1. Don't let conflict linger unresolved.
2. Handle yourself with Christlike humility.

## Don't Let Conflict Linger Unresolved
Conflict in the church is like an acute medical problem - the longer it goes unresolved, the worse things get.  It festers.  Our thoughts dwell on what was said or done, how we've been wronged, and anger builds on anger.  Maybe we don't feel we've been wronged, but we know someone else in the church is upset with us for some reason, even though we're confident we've done nothing wrong.  How or why should *we* take steps towards purusing restoration if they're the one with the anger issue to deal with.

Jesus gave a few instructions for us in these regards.

### Look for your own planks

### Deal with it now

## Handle Yourself with Christlike Humility


<blockquote>
  <p><strong>2</strong><small> If, then, there is any encouragement in Christ, if any consolation of love, if any fellowship with the Spirit, if any affection and mercy, <sup>2</sup>make my joy complete by thinking the same way, having the same love, united in spirit, intent on one purpose. <sup>3</sup>Do nothing out of selfish ambition or conceit, but in humility consider others as more important than yourselves. <sup>4</sup>Everyone should look not to his own interests, but rather to the interests of others.
<br><br>
<sup>5</sup>Adopt the same attitude as that of Christ Jesus,
<br>
<sup>6</sup>who, existing in the form of God,<br>
did not consider equality with God<br>
as something to be exploited.<br>
<sup>7</sup>Instead he emptied himself<br>
by assuming the form of a servant,<br>
taking on the likeness of humanity.<br>
And when he had come as a man,<br>
<sup>8</sup>he humbled himself by becoming obedient<br>
to the point of death—<br>
even to death on a cross.<br>
<sup>9</sup>For this reason God highly exalted him<br>
and gave him the name<br>
that is above every name,<br>
<sup>10</sup>so that at the name of Jesus<br>
every knee will bow—<br>
in heaven and on earth<br>
and under the earth—<br>
<sup>11</sup>and every tongue will confess<br>
that Jesus Christ is Lord,<br>
to the glory of God the Father.</small></p>
